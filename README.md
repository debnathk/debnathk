## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a Graduate Researcher specializing in AI-driven drug discovery, with expertise in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Generative AI (Gen-AI), RNA-Seq analysis, and molecular docking. I have experience in de novo drug design and drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction modeling.

I am passionate about leveraging computational biology and AI to advance precision medicine and cheminformatics. My aspiration is to lead interdisciplinary research integrating AI and pharmacogenomics for drug discovery.
